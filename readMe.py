this is a "dice rolling" app 

a random number generator which leads the user to roll a dice.

Pick a number and it will randomly display a number between 1 and (user input)

written in python and run through the command line

i have an alias setup for dice to get me to the pwd where i have the 
commands saved. I also have an alias setup for 'roll' to run python

 alias roll="python" ; alias dice="cd /Users/will/Documents/python/dice"

it boots whenever i use terminal and i only use it for DnD and Starfinder

sometimes to settle a bet or two ;)
